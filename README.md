# Journal-App
This application is part of the Udacity #7DaysofCodeChallenge. Here I've made use of the best practices building a Journal App.  

Users should be able to:
Login using google authentication.
View all entries to their diary.
View the contents of a diary entry.
Add and modify an entry.


Hope you Enjoy!
